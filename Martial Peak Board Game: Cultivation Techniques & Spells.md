# Martial Peak Board Game: Cultivation Techniques & Spells

## Cultivation Techniques
Cultivation techniques are the primary progression system in the game, allowing players to advance through four cultivation levels:

1. **Qi Condensation**
2. **Foundation Establishment**
3. **Core Foundation**
4. **Nascent Soul**

### Acquisition & Progression
- Techniques can be acquired through **exploration, quests, or vendors**.
- Advancement may require accumulating **Cultivation Points**, rare items, or meditating in special zones.
- Techniques have **rarities**: **Common, Rare, Mythical, Legendary**.
- Some techniques provide **stat boosts or elemental affinities**.

## Spells
Spells are primarily used for **combat or stat bonuses** rather than progression.

### Acquisition
- Found as **loot**, taught by **NPCs**, or unlocked through **cultivation milestones**.

### Categories
1. **Combat Spells** – Deal damage, provide healing, or apply crowd control.
2. **Stat Buffs** – Temporarily increase attributes like defense, agility, or attack.
3. **Utility Spells** – Grant effects like teleportation, stealth, or resource generation.

### Mechanics
- Some spells have **cooldowns** or limited use per encounter.
- Stronger spells may require **higher cultivation levels** (e.g., Core Foundation or higher).

## Summary
- **Cultivation Techniques** enable progression through four cultivation levels and provide unique bonuses.
- **Spells** enhance combat and strategy, divided into combat, stat buffs, and utility categories.
